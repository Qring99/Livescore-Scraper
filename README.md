# Livescore_Scraper
A Node.js command-line tool to scrape football (soccer) fixtures from LiveScore. This script fetches match data, including head-to-head stats, home and away team last matches, and upcoming fixtures for a user-specified date or tomorrow. It saves the scraped data to a Fixtures.json file and logs all output to output.txt for easy reference. Features include interactive date input (YY-MM-DD format), colorized terminal output, and robust error handling. Ideal for football enthusiasts, developers, or anyone interested in match data analysis.
